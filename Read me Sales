Sales Dataset EDA
Project Overview

This project explores a retail sales dataset containing product descriptions, unit prices, quantities sold, and total revenue.
The goal is to uncover insights on top-performing products, seasonal revenue trends, and relationships between key features like Quantity, Unit Price, and Revenue.

1. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed null and duplicate entries.

Converted date columns to datetime format for time-series analysis.

Created a Revenue column = Quantity × UnitPrice.

Filtered invalid or zero values in Quantity and UnitPrice.

Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Top Products by Revenue

Jumbo Bag Red Retrospot is the top-selling product, earning over 200K in total revenue.
Followed by White Hanging Heart and Regency Cakes.

The top 10 products each generate over 10K, showing that a few key products contribute most to overall revenue.

2. Correlation Analysis
Relationship	Correlation	Insight
Quantity ↔ Revenue	+0.41	More items sold = higher revenue
Unit Price ↔ Revenue	+0.30	Higher prices slightly boost revenue
Quantity ↔ Unit Price	–0.32	Lower-priced items tend to sell more

Interpretation:
Revenue depends more on Quantity sold than Unit Price. Cheaper items with higher volume drive overall earnings.

3. Seasonality & Trend Insights

Revenue rises quickly from September to November, peaking in November (~700K).

After December, sales drop sharply, reaching the lowest point in February (~250K).

From April to August, sales remain stable between 320K–360K.

The pattern forms a U-shaped trend — low in early months, steady mid-year, and high at year-end.

Business Implication:

Introduce promotions or discounts during February–March (low months).

Boost inventory and marketing in October–November to maximize profit during peak season.

4.Visualizations

Key Insights Summary

A few products dominate total revenue.

Revenue is more sensitive to sales volume than price.

Strong seasonal behavior — demand peaks in Q4.

February shows the lowest performance and can be targeted for promotional activity.
