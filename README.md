**
**Project Overview**
This project explores a music dataset containing features such as Beats Per Minute (BPM), Energy, Danceability, and Artist information. The goal is to analyze and understand relationships between these features across different genres and artists.

**Contents**
Data cleaning and transformation: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations including histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps to identify patterns, distributions, and correlations.

Key insights: Identification of strong and weak feature relationships, such as the correlation between BPM and dance characteristics.

**What this project does****
This project analyzes a music dataset to understand patterns in song features like tempo, energy, and danceability across different genres and artists.
**
**Why this project is useful****
By exploring relationships between musical features, this project helps music producers, data analysts, and enthusiasts gain insights into music trends and artist styles.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Plotted histograms for all numeric columns to see distribution and spot outliers.

Used boxplots to compare Energy levels by Genre and Beats Per Minute by Artist.

Created correlation heatmaps to find relationships between numeric features.

Purpose: Discover patterns, trends, and potential data quality issues.

**Key Insights from EDA**

Energy varies widely in some genres (dance pop, pop) and is consistent in others (trap, pop house).

Tempo (BPM) varies significantly by artist; some produce a wide tempo range, others consistent.

Strong positive correlation (~0.74) between Beats Per Minute and Beats Per Minute to Dance ratio.

Strong negative correlation (~-0.54) between Danceability and Beats Per Minute to Dance ratio.

Artist Name shows weak correlation with danceability and beats.

Purpose: Identify important relationships that inform future modeling or business decisions.
